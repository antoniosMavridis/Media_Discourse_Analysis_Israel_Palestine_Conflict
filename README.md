# Media Discourse Analysis: Israel-Palestine Conflict
This repository explores the Israel-Palestine conflict through advanced analysis of Reuters articles. It features web scraping, data preprocessing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to uncover media narratives and sentiments on this critical topic.

## Overview
In our series of Jupyter Notebooks, we embark on an exploration of media coverage regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, utilizing targeted web scraping from Reuters to gather articles featuring specific, relevant keywords. Our analytical process includes rigorous data cleaning and normalization to ensure uniformity and readability. We apply advanced natural language processing techniques to extract key themes and narratives. Moreover, we utilize topic modeling methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to uncover the thematic structure of the dataset. Our sentiment analysis, supported by the zero-shot classification technique and the Afinn sentiment analysis tool, evaluates the range of sentiments within the articles, providing a comprehensive view of the media discourse surrounding this complex conflict. This methodology allows us to thoroughly analyze and understand the nuanced portrayals and sentiments in media coverage related to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
